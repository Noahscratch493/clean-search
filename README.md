# Clean Search

**Clean Search** helps you perform Google searches filtered to remove AI-generated content and Wikipedia clutter. It automatically adds `-ai -wikipedia` to your search query, so you get more human-generated and authentic results.

## Features

- **No AI Spam:** Filters out AI-generated articles flooding search results.  
- **Human Content Only:** Finds authentic, human-written articles, blogs, and discussions.  
- **Cleaner Results:** Removes Wikipedia clutter while keeping quality sources.

## How It Works

The site appends `-ai -wikipedia` to your search query, which excludes AI and Wikipedia results from Google searches.

---

## Usage

Simply enter your search query on the live demo page and hit **Search** or press **Enter**. A new tab will open with Google results filtered to remove AI and Wikipedia content.

You can also add `-ai -wikipedia` manually to any Google search to get cleaner results.
